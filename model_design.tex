\label{cha:design_of_the_polymerase_evolution_model}
This chapter provides a detailed description of the design of the model system used to investigate the question of the evolution of polymerase polarity. The goal of this model is to have organisms containing either a $5'\to3'$ or a $3'\to5'$ nucleic acid polymerase compete with each other in order to see which strategies are either evolutionarily dominant or evolutionarily stable. The model is also designed such that the influence of temperature on the outcome of this competition can be investigated.
