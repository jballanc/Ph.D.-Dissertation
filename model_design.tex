\label{cha:design_of_the_polymerase_evolution_model}
In this chapter, I will provide a detailed description of the design of the model system used to investigate the question of the evolution of polymerase polarity. The goal of this model is to have organisms containing either $5'\to3'$ or $3'\to5'$ compete with each other in order to see which strategies are either evolutionarily dominant or evolutionarily stable.
