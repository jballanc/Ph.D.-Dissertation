ABSTRACT \\
\end{center}
It is my goal to use the fundamental principles of thermodynamics to understand life. Specifically, it is my desire to use this approach to investigate evolution as an classical optimization problem. This approach is inspired by the observation that life is, at its most fundamental level, an elaborate collection of chemical reactions. Individually, each of these reactions is governed by the laws of thermodynamics, and thus far there is no known upper limit to the scale at which thermodynamic principles may be applied.

In this work I present a model systems which is inspired by this hypothesis. In this model, I will look at the directionality of nucleotide polymerases, all of which synthesize new nucleotide polymers in a 5' to 3' direction. This phenomenon could be the consequence of a very early founder effect. Alternatively, it could be that this directionality evolved due to an inherent evolutionary advantage. The model I have constructed, based on the fundamentals of nucleic acid chemistry, reveals that under certain conditions there is, in fact, and advantage to $5'\to3'$ synthesis. These results provide an insight into the forces that may have driven early biological evolution.

\noindent \textbf{Acknowledgements} \\[6mm]
I would like to acknowledge Marc Mansfield for the years of guidance, inspiration, and instruction that he so graciously provided during both my undergraduate and graduate education. I would also like to acknowledge Francis Jones for making this research possible, for the encouragement that he provided me as an undergraduate and the opportunity he made available to me as a graduate. I would also like to thank the members of my committee, A. K. Ganguly, Knut Stamnes, and Nicholas Murgolo, for their input and invaluable insight. Thanks also go out to the faculty and staff of the Department of Chemistry, Chemical Biology, and Biomedical Engineering for all the help they have provided through the years, and most especially to Mary Newell without whom I would not have made it past the first day of graduate school. Finally, I must humbly admit that the thesis presented here would not exist if it were not for the constant support and encouragement of my beautiful wife Ceren \"Ornek-Ballanco.
