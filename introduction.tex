Evolution has been, since the time of Darwin, a science mostly concerned with explaining observations and predicting what new evidence from the past should eventually turn up, such as the existence of transitional forms. In this regard, evolution has been wildly successful. Where the study of Evolution has been lacking is in its ability to predict the future. That is, looking at collected fossil and current natural evidence, the Theory of Evolution gives us the ability to identify which selective pressures acted on past populations. What the Theory of Evolution cannot do, at present, is predict which environmental or other influences will act as selective pressures going forward. At best, we can make educated guesses based on past evidence, but we lack even the basic ability to assign a concrete measure of confidence in such predictions.
