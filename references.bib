title = {A generic model for changes in microbial kinetic coefficients},
abstract = {Acclimation patterns in kinetic coefficients clearly demonstrate the limits of Monod's theory for the mathematical description of microbial growth. Focusing on E. coli grown under variable glucose levels, these patterns turn out to be highly diverse and sometimes even contradictory. Here, a new model based on an optimisation assumption is applied to a spectrum of adaptation phenomena, which are observed at steady-state as well as during transient situations. On the level of apparent kinetic coefficients, rates of adaptation are calculated depending on differential growth benefits. The resulting dynamics is bounded since maximum growth rate and substrate affinity are related by a non-linear trade-off. Long-term effects of phenotypic and genotypic changes under glucose limitation are robustly predicted by the model and explained in terms of their adaptive significance. Equivocal short-term recovery patterns occurring after sudden substrate excess are traced back to differences in the internal physiological state of the cells which in turn can be calculated in dependence on the inoculum history. Metabolic stress is a second determinant of short-term variations in kinetic coefficients which is here quantified in relation to external conditions as well as the internal state of cells. We demonstrate that lag phenomena and oscillations in anabolic activity exercised by E. coli under continuous growth acceleration can be reproduced without formulations being explicit in lag periods, metabolite concentrations or the timing of experimental changes. The overall predictive power of the simple approach indicates that slow as well as fast adjustments in apparent kinetic characteristics are strongly related to a dynamic optimisation strategy.},

title = {On the application of statistical physics to evolutionary biology},
abstract = {There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log(W), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G=E[log(W)+U+S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log(W)+U+S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.},

title = {'Growth of bacterial cultures' 50 years on: towards an uncertainty principle instead of constants in bacterial growth kinetics},
abstract = {Ever since Monod's efforts to study bacterial cultures in quantitative terms, the growth of Escherichia coli on sugars like glucose has appeared an attractive subject for the mathematical description of nutrient conversion into biomass. But instead of simplicity, it is becoming evident that bacterial adaptations affect 'constants' such as K(s) (growth affinity constant) and are, in turn, a complex function of nutrient concentration. Instead of a single affinity, bacteria exhibit a continuum of nutrient scavenging abilities peaking at micromolar sugar levels; there is lower affinity with millimolar or submicromolar glucose in the medium. Similar problems arise in defining parameters such as Y (growth yield constant), because nutrient-limited growth at low exponential growth rates induces a continuum of hunger and starvation responses. Autocatalytic changes to the environment caused by growth (as well as external factors) ensure that bacteria present an ever-adapting interface to the outside world. The regulatory interaction between the organism and environment means that no universal kinetic constants describe bacterial growth.},

title = {Evaluation of single-base substitution rate in DNA by affinity capillary electrophoresis},
abstract = {Capillary electrophoretic separation of 60 mer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a single-base-substituted ssDNA was demonstrated using a size- and composition-controlled poly(ethylene glycol)-oligodeoxyribonucleotide block copolymer (PEG-b-ODN) as an affinity ligand. Under appropriate conditions, PEG-b-ODN and ssDNA with a complementary sequence formed a reversible complex via hybridization during the electrophoresis, while the copolymer did not interact with the single-base-substituted ssDNA. The copolymer's PEG length determined the electrophoretic mobility of the ssDNA; upon formation of the complex, the electrically neutral PEG added hydrodynamic friction to ssDNA. Simultaneously using two types of PEG-b-ODN copolymers whose PEG segments were of different lengths, we achieved the complete separation of the 60 mer ssDNA, its single-base-substituted ssDNA, and impurities. This method was sensitive enough to quantify a slight amount (approximately 1%) of the single-base-substituted ssDNA. The present results suggest that our approach is applicable to quantitative detection of minor genotypes.},

title = {Enhanced thermal stability and mismatch discrimination of mutation-carrying DNA duplexes and their kinetic and thermodynamic properties in microchannel laminar flow},
abstract = {This article reports the enhancement of thermal stability involving normal duplex and mutation-carrying DNA duplexes in microchannel laminar flow. The application of an in-house temperature-controllable microchannel-type flow cell is demonstrated for improved discrimination of mismatch base pairs such as A-G and T-G that are difficult to distinguish due to the rather small thermal destabilizations. Enhancement in thermal stability is reflected by an increased thermal melting temperature achieved in microchannel laminar flow as compared with batch reactions. To examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of duplex-coil equilibrium of DNA oligomers, denaturation-renaturation hysteresis curves were measured. The influence of microchannel laminar flow on DNA base mismatch analysis was described from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. An increasing trend was observed for association rate constant as flow rate increased. In contrast, an apparent decrease in dissociation rate constant was observed with increasing flow rate. The magnitudes of the activation energies of dissociation were nearly constant for both the batch and microchannel laminar flow systems at all flow rates. In contrast, the magnitudes of activation energies of association decreased as flow rate increased. These results clearly show how microchannel laminar flow induces change in reaction rate by effecting change in activation energy. We anticipate, therefore, that this approach based on microchannel laminar flow system holds great promise for improved mismatch discrimination in DNA analyses, particularly on single-base-pair mismatch, by pronouncedly enhancing thermal stability.},

title = {Effects of temperature on the fitness cost of resistance to bacteriophage T4 in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {Resistance to predation, herbivory, or disease often comes at a cost such that resistant genotypes are competitively inferior to their sensitive counterparts in the absence of predators, herbivores, or pathogens. The effects of this trade-off on natural populations depend on its sensitivity to environmental changes. We used Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 as a model predator/prey system to study the effects of temperature on the cost of resistance. An array of independent T4-resistant mutants, derived from a single ancestral strain of E. coli B, had a mean reduction in competitive fitness that depended strongly on environmental temperature; the cost of resistance generally increased with temperature. Genetic variance for fitness among phage-resistant mutants also depended on temperature; however, genetic variance increased at high and low thermal extremes. These results suggest that temperature is likely to be an important determinant of the consequences of predation in natural communities. We also discuss the underlying mechanistic basis for the cost of resistance in this system and its interaction with temperature.},

title = {On the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes of a bacterial metabolic network},
abstract = {The mechanisms by which adaptive phenotypes spread within an evolving population after their emergence are understood fairly well. Much less is known about the factors that influence the evolutionary accessibility of such phenotypes, a pre-requisite for their emergence in a population. Here, we investigate the influence of environmental quality on the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes of Escherichia coli's central metabolic network. We used an established flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a genotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively different environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic metabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a more rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that adaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such environments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by neutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could allow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found that the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative to phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit information about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with (simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in different environments. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple analytic theory and they suggest an intuitive information-theoretic principle for evolutionary adaptation; adaptation could be faster in environments where the GPM has a greater capacity to transmit information about phenotype differences.},
