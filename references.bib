title = {'Growth of bacterial cultures' 50 years on: towards an uncertainty principle instead of constants in bacterial growth kinetics},
abstract = {Ever since Monod's efforts to study bacterial cultures in quantitative terms, the growth of Escherichia coli on sugars like glucose has appeared an attractive subject for the mathematical description of nutrient conversion into biomass. But instead of simplicity, it is becoming evident that bacterial adaptations affect 'constants' such as K(s) (growth affinity constant) and are, in turn, a complex function of nutrient concentration. Instead of a single affinity, bacteria exhibit a continuum of nutrient scavenging abilities peaking at micromolar sugar levels; there is lower affinity with millimolar or submicromolar glucose in the medium. Similar problems arise in defining parameters such as Y (growth yield constant), because nutrient-limited growth at low exponential growth rates induces a continuum of hunger and starvation responses. Autocatalytic changes to the environment caused by growth (as well as external factors) ensure that bacteria present an ever-adapting interface to the outside world. The regulatory interaction between the organism and environment means that no universal kinetic constants describe bacterial growth.},

title = {Non-equilibrium thermodynamics of gene expression and transcriptional regulation},
abstract = {In recent times whole-genome gene expression analysis has turned out to be a highly important tool to study the coordinated function of a very large number of genes within their corresponding cellular environment, especially in relation to phenotypic diversity and disease. A wide variety of methods of quantitative analysis have been developed to cope with high throughput data sets generated by gene expression profiling experiments. Due to the complexity associated with transcriptomics, specially in the case of gene regulation phenomena, most of these methods are of a probabilistic or statistical nature. Even if these methods have reached a central status in the development of an integrative, systematic understanding of the associated biological processes, they very rarely constitute a concrete guide to the actual physicochemical mechanisms behind biological function and the role of these methods is more on a hypotheses generating line. An important improvement could be done with the development of a thermodynamic theory for gene expression and transcriptional regulation that will build the foundations for a proper integration of the vast amount of molecular biophysical data and could lead, in the future, to a systemic view of genetic transcription and regulation.},

title = {Effects of temperature on the fitness cost of resistance to bacteriophage T4 in Escherichia coli},
abstract = {Resistance to predation, herbivory, or disease often comes at a cost such that resistant genotypes are competitively inferior to their sensitive counterparts in the absence of predators, herbivores, or pathogens. The effects of this trade-off on natural populations depend on its sensitivity to environmental changes. We used Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 as a model predator/prey system to study the effects of temperature on the cost of resistance. An array of independent T4-resistant mutants, derived from a single ancestral strain of E. coli B, had a mean reduction in competitive fitness that depended strongly on environmental temperature; the cost of resistance generally increased with temperature. Genetic variance for fitness among phage-resistant mutants also depended on temperature; however, genetic variance increased at high and low thermal extremes. These results suggest that temperature is likely to be an important determinant of the consequences of predation in natural communities. We also discuss the underlying mechanistic basis for the cost of resistance in this system and its interaction with temperature.},

journal = {J Theor Biol},
title = {On the application of statistical physics to evolutionary biology},
abstract = {There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log(W), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G=E[log(W)+U+S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log(W)+U+S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.},

title = {Protein tolerance to random amino acid change},
abstract = {Mutagenesis of protein-encoding sequences occurs ubiquitously; it enables evolution, accumulates during aging, and is associated with disease. Many biotechnological methods exploit random mutations to evolve novel proteins. To quantitate protein tolerance to random change, it is vital to understand the probability that a random amino acid replacement will lead to a protein's functional inactivation. We define this probability as the "x factor." Here, we develop a broadly applicable approach to calculate x factors and demonstrate this method using the human DNA repair enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG). Three gene-wide mutagenesis libraries were created, each with 10(5) diversity and averaging 2.2, 4.6, and 6.2 random amino acid changes per mutant. After determining the percentage of functional mutants in each library using high-stringency selection (>19,000-fold), the x factor was found to be 34% +/- 6%. Remarkably, reanalysis of data from studies of diverse proteins reveals similar inactivation probabilities. To delineate the nature of tolerated amino acid substitutions, we sequenced 244 surviving AAG mutants. The 920 tolerated substitutions were characterized by substitutability index and mapped onto the AAG primary, secondary, and known tertiary structures. Evolutionarily conserved residues show low substitutability indices. In AAG, beta strands are on average less substitutable than alpha helices; and surface loops that are not involved in DNA binding are the most substitutable. Our results are relevant to such diverse topics as applied molecular evolution, the rate of introduction of deleterious alleles into genomes in evolutionary history, and organisms' tolerance of mutational burden.},

title = {Synthesis of adenosine triphosphate and exchange between inorganic phosphate and adenosine triphosphate in sodium and potassium ion transport adenosine triphosphatase},
abstract = {Radioactive adenosine triphosphate was synthesized transiently from adenosine diphosphate and radioactive inorganic phosphate by sodium and potassium adenosine triphosphatase from guinea pig kidney. In a first step, K+-sensitive phosphoenzyme was formed from radioactive inorganic phosphate in the presence of magnesium ion and 16 mM sodium ion. In a second step the addition to the phosphoenzyme of adenosine diphosphate with a higher concentration of sodium ion produced adenosine triphosphate. Recovery of adenosine triphosphate from the phosphoenzyme was 10 to 100% in the presence of 96 to 1200 mM sodium ion, respectively. Potassium ion (16mM) inhibited synthesis if added before or simultaneously with the high concentration of sodium ion but had no effect afterward. The half-maximal concentration for adenosine diphosphate was about 12 muM. Ouabain inhibited synthesis. The ionophore gramicidin had no significant effect on the level of phosphoenzyme nor on the rate nor on the extent of synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. The detergent Lubrol WX reduced the rate of phosphoenzyme break-down and the rate of synthesis but did not affect the final recovery. Phospholipase A treatment inhibited synthesis. In a steady state, the enzyme catalzyed a slow ouabain-sensitive incorporation or inorganic phosphate into adenosine triphosphate. These results and other suggest that binding of sodium ion to a low affinity site on phosphoenzyme formed from inorganic phosphate is sufficient to induce a conformational change in the active center which permits transfer of the phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate.},

title = {A generic model for changes in microbial kinetic coefficients},
abstract = {Acclimation patterns in kinetic coefficients clearly demonstrate the limits of Monod's theory for the mathematical description of microbial growth. Focusing on E. coli grown under variable glucose levels, these patterns turn out to be highly diverse and sometimes even contradictory. Here, a new model based on an optimisation assumption is applied to a spectrum of adaptation phenomena, which are observed at steady-state as well as during transient situations. On the level of apparent kinetic coefficients, rates of adaptation are calculated depending on differential growth benefits. The resulting dynamics is bounded since maximum growth rate and substrate affinity are related by a non-linear trade-off. Long-term effects of phenotypic and genotypic changes under glucose limitation are robustly predicted by the model and explained in terms of their adaptive significance. Equivocal short-term recovery patterns occurring after sudden substrate excess are traced back to differences in the internal physiological state of the cells which in turn can be calculated in dependence on the inoculum history. Metabolic stress is a second determinant of short-term variations in kinetic coefficients which is here quantified in relation to external conditions as well as the internal state of cells. We demonstrate that lag phenomena and oscillations in anabolic activity exercised by E. coli under continuous growth acceleration can be reproduced without formulations being explicit in lag periods, metabolite concentrations or the timing of experimental changes. The overall predictive power of the simple approach indicates that slow as well as fast adjustments in apparent kinetic characteristics are strongly related to a dynamic optimisation strategy.},

title = {Open-system thermodynamic analysis of DNA polymerase fidelity},
abstract = {Replication inside a living cell, carried out by DNA polymerase, has an error rate far below that predicted by equilibrium thermodynamics from the affinities between nucleotides and a polymerase complex. The high fidelity is achieved through several distinctly different molecular mechanisms that include a nucleotide insertion checkpoint and 3'-5' exonuclease activity. The checkpoint mechanism has recently been articulated as a new paradigm for high specificity. A rigorous thermodynamic analysis of the bare DNA polymerization reaction, i.e., in the absence of exonuclease activity and proofreading, is developed in this paper. The analysis (a) reveals the important role of nonequilibrium steady-state (NESS) flux that drives high fidelity, (b) quantifies the error rate of the polymerization reaction as a function of free energy input through sustained non-equilibrium between chemical species, (c) bridges the 'thermodynamic' and 'kinetic' views of specificity and (d) generalizes the theory of kinetic checkpoints and provides it with a sound thermodynamic basis. The underlying mechanism again calls attention to the energy expenditure in heightened biomolecular specificity, a concept first developed by Hopfield and Ninio in the mid-1970s. The mechanism discussed in the present paper is not limited to DNA replication alone; it may be applicable to other biochemical systems.},

abstract = {For the simplest kinetic model the reverse rate constants (k(-1) and k(-2)) associated with ATP binding and cleavage on purified heavy meromyosin and heavy meromyosin subfragment 1 from rabbit skeletal muscle in the presence of 5mm-MgCl(2), 50mm-KCl and 20mm-Tris-HCl buffer at pH8.0 and 22 degrees C are: k(-1)<0.02s(-1) and k(-1)=16s(-1). Apparently, higher values of k(-1) and k(-2) are found with less-purified protein preparations. The values of k(-1) and k(-2) satisfy conditions required by previous (18)O-incorporation studies of H(2) (18)O into the P(i) moiety on ATP hydrolysis and suggest that the cleavage step does involve hydrolysis of ATP or formation of an adduct between ATP and water. The equilibrium constant for the cleavage step at the myosin active site is 9. If the cycle of events during muscle contraction is described by the model proposed by Lymn {\&} Taylor (1971), the fact that there is only a small negative standard free-energy change for the cleavage step is advantageous for efficient chemical to mechanical energy exchange during muscle contraction.},

title = {DNA polymerase fidelity: from genetics toward a biochemical understanding},
abstract = {This review summarizes mutagenesis studies, emphasizing the use of bacteriophage T4 mutator and antimutator strains. Early genetic studies on T4 identified mutator and antimutator variants of DNA polymerase that, in turn, stimulated the development of model systems for the study of DNA polymerase fidelity in vitro. Later enzymatic studies using purified T4 mutator and antimutator polymerases were essential in elucidating mechanisms of base selection and exonuclease proofreading. In both cases, the base analogue 2-aminopurine (2AP) proved tremendously useful-first as a mutagen in vivo and then as a probe of DNA polymerase fidelity in vitro. Investigations into mechanisms of DNA polymerase fidelity inspired theoretical models that, in turn, called for kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. Thus, the field of DNA synthesis fidelity has grown from many directions: genetics, enzymology, kinetics, physical biochemistry, and thermodynamics, and today the interplay continues. The relative contributions of hydrogen bonding and base stacking to the accuracy of DNA synthesis are beginning to be deciphered. For the future, the main challenges lie in understanding the origins of mutational hot and cold spots.},

title = {On the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes of a bacterial metabolic network},
abstract = {The mechanisms by which adaptive phenotypes spread within an evolving population after their emergence are understood fairly well. Much less is known about the factors that influence the evolutionary accessibility of such phenotypes, a pre-requisite for their emergence in a population. Here, we investigate the influence of environmental quality on the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes of Escherichia coli's central metabolic network. We used an established flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a genotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively different environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic metabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a more rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that adaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such environments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by neutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could allow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found that the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative to phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit information about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with (simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in different environments. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple analytic theory and they suggest an intuitive information-theoretic principle for evolutionary adaptation; adaptation could be faster in environments where the GPM has a greater capacity to transmit information about phenotype differences.},

title = {Comparison between DNA melting thermodynamics and DNA polymerase fidelity},
abstract = {The relation between DNA polymerase fidelity and base pairing stability is investigated by using DNA primer-template duplexes that contain a common 9-base template sequence but have either correct (A.T) or incorrect (G.T, C.T, T.T) base pairs at the primer 3' terminus. Thermal melting and enzyme kinetic measurements are compared for each kind of terminus. Analysis of melting temperatures finds that differences between the free energy changes upon dissociation (delta delta Go) are only 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kcal.mol-1 (1 cal = 4.18 J) for terminal A.T compared to G.T, C.T, and T.T mispairs, respectively, at 37 degrees C. We show that enthalpy changes are directly correlated with entropy changes for normal and abnormal base pairs in DNA in aqueous solution and that delta delta Go values are small because of near cancellation of corresponding enthalpy and entropy components. The kinetics of elongating primer termini are measured with purified Drosophila DNA polymerase alpha. The matched A.T terminus is found to be extended approximately 200 times faster than a G.T mismatch and 1400 and 2500 times faster than C.T and T.T mismatches, respectively. Enzymatic discrimination against elongating mismatched termini is based mainly on Km rather than Vmax differences. From Km at 37 degrees C, we find delta delta Go values of 2.6-3.7 kcal.mol-1, about an order of magnitude greater than indicated by melting data. A similar measurement of nucleotide insertion kinetics has previously found rates of forming A.T base pairs to be 500 times greater than G.T mispairs and 20,000 times greater than C.T and T.T mispairs. Here also, Km differences are mainly responsible for discrimination and indicate even larger delta delta Go values (4.3-4.9 kcal.mol-1). Thus, free energy differences between correct and incorrect base pairs in the active site cleft of polymerase appear to be greater than 10 times as large as in aqueous medium. We explore the idea that a binding cleft that snugly fits correct base pairs and excludes water at the active site may amplify base-pair free energy differences by reducing entropy differences and increasing enthalpy differences sufficiently to account for nucleotide insertion and extension fidelity.},

title = {Evaluation of single-base substitution rate in DNA by affinity capillary electrophoresis},
abstract = {Capillary electrophoretic separation of 60 mer single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a single-base-substituted ssDNA was demonstrated using a size- and composition-controlled poly(ethylene glycol)-oligodeoxyribonucleotide block copolymer (PEG-b-ODN) as an affinity ligand. Under appropriate conditions, PEG-b-ODN and ssDNA with a complementary sequence formed a reversible complex via hybridization during the electrophoresis, while the copolymer did not interact with the single-base-substituted ssDNA. The copolymer's PEG length determined the electrophoretic mobility of the ssDNA; upon formation of the complex, the electrically neutral PEG added hydrodynamic friction to ssDNA. Simultaneously using two types of PEG-b-ODN copolymers whose PEG segments were of different lengths, we achieved the complete separation of the 60 mer ssDNA, its single-base-substituted ssDNA, and impurities. This method was sensitive enough to quantify a slight amount (approximately 1%) of the single-base-substituted ssDNA. The present results suggest that our approach is applicable to quantitative detection of minor genotypes.},

title = {Enhanced thermal stability and mismatch discrimination of mutation-carrying DNA duplexes and their kinetic and thermodynamic properties in microchannel laminar flow},
abstract = {This article reports the enhancement of thermal stability involving normal duplex and mutation-carrying DNA duplexes in microchannel laminar flow. The application of an in-house temperature-controllable microchannel-type flow cell is demonstrated for improved discrimination of mismatch base pairs such as A-G and T-G that are difficult to distinguish due to the rather small thermal destabilizations. Enhancement in thermal stability is reflected by an increased thermal melting temperature achieved in microchannel laminar flow as compared with batch reactions. To examine the kinetics and thermodynamics of duplex-coil equilibrium of DNA oligomers, denaturation-renaturation hysteresis curves were measured. The influence of microchannel laminar flow on DNA base mismatch analysis was described from the kinetic and thermodynamic perspectives. An increasing trend was observed for association rate constant as flow rate increased. In contrast, an apparent decrease in dissociation rate constant was observed with increasing flow rate. The magnitudes of the activation energies of dissociation were nearly constant for both the batch and microchannel laminar flow systems at all flow rates. In contrast, the magnitudes of activation energies of association decreased as flow rate increased. These results clearly show how microchannel laminar flow induces change in reaction rate by effecting change in activation energy. We anticipate, therefore, that this approach based on microchannel laminar flow system holds great promise for improved mismatch discrimination in DNA analyses, particularly on single-base-pair mismatch, by pronouncedly enhancing thermal stability.},

abstract = {We consider the optimal dynamics in the infinite population evolution models with general symmetric fitness landscape. The search of optimal evolution trajectories are complicated due to sharp transitions (like shock waves) in evolution dynamics with smooth fitness landscapes, which exist even in case of popular quadratic fitness. We found exact analytical solutions for discontinuous dynamics at the large genome length limit. We found the optimal mutation rates for the fixed fitness landscape. The single peak fitness landscape gives the fastest dynamics to send the vast majority of the population from the initial sequence to the neighborhood of the final sequence.},

title = {Metal-ion-promoted dephosphorylation of the 5'-triphosphates of uridine and thymidine, and a comparison with the reactivity in the corresponding cytidine and adenosine nucleotide systems},
abstract = {First-order rate constants (50 degrees C; I = 0.1 M, NaClO4) for the dephosphorylation of UTP and TTP (1 mM) in the pH range 2-10 are compared with those of ATP and CTP; they all show the same properties indicating that the nucleic base has no influence on the rate. In the presence of Cu2+ or Zn2+ (NTP:M2+ = 1:1) this changes drastically: ATP-M2+ much greater than UTP-M2+ approximately equal to TTP-M2+ approximately equal to CTP-M2+ greater than NTP, the Cu2+ systems being always more reactive than the Zn2+ systems, and these more than the Ni2+ systems. An interaction between the nucleic base and metal ion is important for the Cu2+-ATP and Zn2+-ATP systems, but not for the pyrimidine-nucleotide systems (these behave like methyltriphosphate). Accordingly, prevention of the Cu2+-purine interaction by the addition of one equivalent of 2,2'-bipyridyl, leading to Cu(Bpy) (NTP)2-, strongly reduces the activity and all four ternary Cu2+ systems now show the same dephosphorylation rate. Addition of a second equivalent of Cu2+ to the Cu2+-UTP 1:1 system enhances the dephosphorylation rate significantly and Job's method provides evidence that a 2:1 complex is the most reactive intermediate. The relation between the initial rate, vo = d[PO3-4]/dt, and the concentration of Cu2+-UTP in 1:1 and 2:1 systems was determined. The results suggest that the reactive complex with pyrimidine nucleotides is a monomeric, dinuclear species of the type M2(NTP) (OH)- (its formation is inhibited by ligands like tryptophanate), while with M2+-ATP the reactive complex is a dimer. The connection between the indicated dephosphorylations in vitro, i.e. trans-phosphorylations to H2O, and related reactions in vivo are discussed.},
